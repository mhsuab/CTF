> Theres something in the [building](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/aec3861fc4d5bce4d39dc0db196426de/buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?



Find a online png decoder.

What I use here was [Steganography](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/).

Upload the file ‘building.png’ and the flag can be found in the hidden message.
