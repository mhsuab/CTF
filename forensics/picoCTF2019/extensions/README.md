# picoCTF2019: extensions

> This is a really weird text file [TXT](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/45886ed4b6d5d1dc74c4944fcf4b4041/flag.txt)? Can you find the flag?



```shell
$ file flag.txt
flag.txt: PNG image data, 1697 x 608, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
```

The TXT file is actually a PNG image.

Change its extension and the flag can be found.
