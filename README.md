# CTF

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and Mixed. In this course and in our final project, we only focus on Jeopardy-style CTFs. A Jeopardy-style CTF has several challenges(tasks) in range of categories, including web, crypto, reverse, forensic, binary, and so on.

It is called “Capture the Flag” because each team is aimed to solve the challenges and find a specific piece of text, the flag.

## Crypto

Challenges require encrypting and decrypting information.

## Reverse

Challenges require reverse engineering analysis of source code or executable files.

## Forensics

Challenges involve examining and processing hidden information in the static data files.

## Binary Exploit

Challenges contain program with vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain control of shell or change the execution path of the program.

## Web

Challenges related to webs, such as php/javescript language abuse, input injection, etc.

## Misc

Challenges don't fall in the previous categories.
