## Buffer Overflow

**Buffer overflow** occurs when data written to a buffer overflows the buffer’s capacity, which result in overwriting the memory in adjacent locations. Buffers are memory storage regions that hold transferred data temporarily. Therefore, by overflowing the buffers, the execution path of the program will be changed which might damage the program, <u>expose private information</u>, or <u>gain control over the program</u>. As a result, by knowing the memory layout of a program, one can intentionally feed input that the buffer cannot store, and overwrite areas that hold executable code, replacing it with their own code.

## Shellcode

## ret2libc

**Return-to-libc attack** is a method of exploiting a <u>buffer overflow</u> on a system having <u>non-executable stack</u>. It is similar to <u>standard buffer overflow</u>, change the return address to point at a new location where can be controlled. However, since no executable code is allowed on the stack, we didn’t just inject shellcode but overwrite the address with a function on libc, the standard C library which contains all the standard functions that can be used by any C program. As the function do not reside on stack, we can then bypass the stack protection and execute the code.

## ROP
